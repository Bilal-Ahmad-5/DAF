# DAF — Data Analysis & Forecasting

**DAF** (Data Analysis & Forecasting) is a notebook-driven project that provides exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and forecasting workflows. This repository is organized as a reproducible analytical pipeline intended for data scientists and engineers who want a clear, shareable notebook that documents end-to-end analysis and model development.

## Project Overview

This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (`DAF (1).ipynb`) and focuses on data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and forecasting results. The notebook includes visualizations, model diagnostics, and a reproducible process to regenerate results from raw data.

Typical use cases:
- Exploratory data analysis for time series or tabular datasets.
- Rapid prototyping of forecasting or regression models.
- Producing reproducible model outputs and visualizations for stakeholders.

---

## Key Components

- **Data ingestion** — Load datasets from CSV, Excel, or database sources.
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** — Missing value handling, type conversions, scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Summary statistics, distributions, correlations, and visual diagnostics.
- **Feature engineering** — Lag/rolling features, date-time decomposition, categorical handling.
- **Modeling** — Baseline models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and forecasting models.
- **Evaluation** — Metrics, residual analysis, and visual model comparisons.
- **Export** — Save model artifacts, evaluation reports, and plots for presentation.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into logical sections (one per major step). Expect headings similar to:

1. Introduction & objectives
2. Environment and dependencies
3. Data loading
4. Data cleaning & preprocessing
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6. Feature engineering
7. Model selection & training
8. Model evaluation & diagnostics
9. Forecasting / prediction
10. Saving results & next steps

Each section is annotated with Markdown cells describing intent and key findings to make the notebook self-documenting for reviewers.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ recommended.
- Typical Python libraries used in this project (install via `requirements.txt` or individually):
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xgboost, prophet (optional), jupyterlab
  - notebook-specific: ipywidgets, plotly (optional)
  - environment management: pip or conda

---

## Installation

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone githttps://github.com/Bilal-Ahmad-5/DAF.git
cd DAF

# create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows (PowerShell)

# install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install minimal packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab
```

---

## Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Lab / Notebook:
```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```
2. Open `DAF.ipynb` from the file browser.
3. Run cells sequentially (use `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` to reproduce results from top to bottom).

**Google Colab**: Upload the notebook to Colab or open directly via GitHub. Make sure to upload any required data files or mount Google Drive for large datasets.

---

## Reproducibility

- Fix random seeds in modeling sections (e.g., `np.random.seed(42)`, `random_state=42`) to ensure identical results across runs.
- Pin package versions in `requirements.txt` to avoid differences caused by library updates.
- Save intermediate datasets and model artifacts to `./data/` and `./models/` respectively for traceability.

---

## Outputs

The notebook typically produces:
- Plots and interactive visuals summarizing data and model performance.
- A saved model artifact (e.g., pickle file) under `./models/` (if implemented).
- CSV summary of model predictions and evaluation metrics under `./outputs/`.

Add a `results/` or `reports/` folder to store final deliverables for stakeholders (e.g., PDF export of notebook, PNGs of key plots).

---

## Development Notes

- If the notebook depends on large datasets, prefer using dataset download scripts or a `data/README.md` explaining how to obtain the data.
- Modularize repeated preprocessing steps into helper scripts (e.g., `src/preprocessing.py`) and import them from the notebook to keep cells concise.
- Consider converting stable notebook workflows into Python scripts (`src/`) for CI testing and automation.
